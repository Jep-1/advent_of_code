# Jep's 2023 Advent of Code


This is the **first** time I'm participating in this event (or any coding challenge for that matter), and as a beginner to programming I find it quite fun and challenging. I'm uploading all my code here to document my progress and to look back and see what I learned. Also so I can share my code quickly with my peers to review.

I am currently (**3.5**) days behind. So hopefully I find some time to get caught up.
